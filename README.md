# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis

### 🔍 Overview
This project explores the global spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Worldometer dataset. It performs a complete data pipeline — from cleaning to EDA and visualization — to uncover meaningful insights about cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing across different countries.

### 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Techniques**: Data Cleaning, Grouping, Aggregation, Sorting, Correlation Analysis, Visual Storytelling

### 📈 Key Insights
- Identified top 10 countries by cases and deaths.
- Analyzed continent-level statistics and testing rates.
- Explored recovery-to-death ratios and infection trends.
- Built interactive visualizations to show global comparisons.

### ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Real-world dataset handling
- Writing reusable functions for data loading
- Building clear and insightful charts
- Presenting data through interactive dashboards (Plotly)

### 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Worldometer COVID-19 Data](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)
- Columns used: Country, Total Cases, Deaths, Tests, Population, etc.

### 💡 Conclusion
This project shows how data science can help track and communicate the impact of global health crises. It reflects my ability to combine data wrangling, statistical thinking, and visualization into actionable insights.
